### Introducing bubby

- Meet `Bubby`, a `GPT-powered bot` that can provide you with answers through Telegram or directly from your terminal.

#### Setup:

- Add the following lines to your `$HOME/.bash_profile` or `$HOME/.bashrc` (if you are using `zsh` then `~/.zprofile` or `~/.zshrc`):

- `export TELEGRAM_TOKEN="TELEGRAM_TOKEN"`.
- `export OPEN_AI_API_KEY="OPEN_AI_API_KEY"`.

- Create an alias for `Bubby` by adding the following line to your shell configuration file:

`alias bubby="python [project_path]/command.py"`.
- replace `project_path` with the path of where the project cloned.

Then, you can interact with `Bubby` in two ways:

- Type `bubby` and use your microphone to ask a question verbally.
- Type `bubby` "your_question_here" to receive an answer directly in the terminal.

Trust me `Bubby` is very useful ;).
