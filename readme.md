### GPT telegram Bot

- To begin, you'll need to create a bot on Telegram.
- After creating the bot, you'll need to create a channel and add the bot to it.
- To install the necessary dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run `python -B main.py`

- This is a custom integration that takes advantage of the Telegram voice-to-text feature to convert audio messages to text. 
  The text is then passed to GPT, a powerful language model, to generate responses and facilitate chatbot conversations.
